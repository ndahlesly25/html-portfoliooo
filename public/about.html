<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Hello.</h2>
<p>I am an iOS and Web Developer. I'm the founder and CEO of The METTLER Laboratory Company. I love coding and making my own snacks.</p>

<h2>My Skills.</h2>
<h3>Design & Development</h3>
<p>I started learning to code when I was 28 years old because I wanted to make my own video games.<br> Over time, I have gained a wealth of experience designing and developing mobile and web applications.</p>

<h3>Hot Coffee Challenge</h3>
<p>But my best skill is actually in drinking hot coffee. I am the undisputed king of hot coffee challenges. Ghost Peppers and Carolina Reapers are my favourite snacks. <br>If you have a knack for consuming copious amounts of coffee without getting jittery, this skill shows my ability to stay energized and focused during long work hours.</p>
